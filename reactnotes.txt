React was created by Facebook (Now Meta).

DOM = Document Object Model

React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) "to update only the parts of the website that have changed." >> Much faster updates.

"Allows developers to group related code together, ... making building and maintaining large scale applications much less complex."

large community and open source

# code: <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin></script>
# code: <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin></script>

^^ these are two script tags that add the React library to the head of our HTML doc. not prefered for large projects?

script to enable JSX:

# code: <script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6/babel.min.js"></script>

"This approach of adding React to a website is only suitable for creating small demos."

need containter to display something using react:

# code: <div id="container"></div>
Note: ^^ doesn't have to be id'd as "container"

# code:
# <script type="text/babel">
# ReactDOM.render(
#	<h1>Hello, React</h1>
#	document.getElementById('container')
# )
# </script>

# code:
# <div id="root">
# </div>

First two lessons complete.
